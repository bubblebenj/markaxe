Customizable markup-to-Html parser/formater library

It support the following formats :


 * split the code into paragraphs (when there is an empty line)
 * add linebreaks otherwise	
 * `[tag]....[/tag]` : will call `formatTag` so you can build any HTML you want from it
 * `[tag=attrib]...[/tab]` : same but with an attribute (can be anything not including ] or newlines)
 * ` * ....` : lines items are a star prefixed by one or many spaces, which will give the identation for sublists
 * each plain text element goes through `formatPlainText` which can do the additional tricks (htmlEscape, but also autolinks, etc.)
 * `====== title ======` : h1 title, (use less = for h2,h3,...)
 * `<node>...</node>` : similar to tags but the content is not parsed, will call `formatNode` which can return null to keep it as-it
 * `@url@` : create an img. <img src="url" />
 * `http://url` : create a link. <a href="http://url">http://url</a>
